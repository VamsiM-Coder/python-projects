Python Projects

      This repository contains three beginner-to-intermediate Python projects covering data analysis, machine learning, and image processing.

🔹 Project 1: Linear Regression

Implements simple linear regression using a CSV dataset with one feature and one target column. Visualizes the regression line and reports metrics like MSE and R² score.

Libraries:       
   
         pandas, numpy, matplotlib, scikit-learn

🔹 Project 2: Data Analysis

Performs exploratory data analysis (EDA) including data cleaning, statistical summaries, and visualizations like histograms, box plots, and scatter plots.

Libraries:
        
         pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn

🔹 Project 3: Image Converter

Converts image files between formats (e.g., PNG to JPEG) using the Pillow library.

Libraries:
        
         Pillow

Conclusion

These projects demonstrate key concepts in Python across data science and utility programming. Ideal for learning EDA, regression modeling, and file handling with practical code examples.
